Problem:
    Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function
definition can support this property of an algorithm
Solution:
1. Start
2. Read the first number
3. Rad the second number
4. If the first number is greater than the second number then the first number is greatest
5. else the second number is the greatest
6. Stop
• Examine the above algorithm, though the algorithm is intended to find the largest among numbers 3 and 5 it is written
as a generalized algorithm that can find the largest among any two given numbers.
• The individual problems that make up a class of problems are known as problem instances.
• In the above algorithm, the problems instances are two numbers between which the greatest should be found.
• The algorithm that we write should be capable of solving different problem instances but not a few among them.
• This is how the algorithms solve a general class of problems.
