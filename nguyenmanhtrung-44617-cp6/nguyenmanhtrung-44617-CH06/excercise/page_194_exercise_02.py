Problem:
   What is the scope of a variable? Give an example.
initialized in a program?
Solution:
Scope refers to the lifetime and accessibility of a variable. How large the scope is depends on where a variable is
declared. For example, if a variable is declared at the top of a class then it will accessible to all of the class
 methods. If itâ€™s declared in a method then it can only be used in that method.
