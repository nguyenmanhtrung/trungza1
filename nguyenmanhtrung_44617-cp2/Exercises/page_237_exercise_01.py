Problem: Explain the advantages and disadvantages of lossless and lossy image file compression schemes.
Solution:
    Once an image has been sampled, it can be stored in one of many file formats. A raw image file saves all
of the sampled information. This has a cost and a benefit: The benefit is that the display of a raw image
will be the most true to life, but the cost is that the file size of the image can be quite large.
Back in the days when disk storage was still expensive, computer scientists developed several schemes
to compress the data of an image to minimize its file size. Although storage is now cheap, these formats
are still quite economical for sending images across networks.
