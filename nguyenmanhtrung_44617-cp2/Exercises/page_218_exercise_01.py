Problem:Explain the importance of the interface of a class of objects
Solution:
    Graphics is the discipline that underlies the representation and display of geometric shapes
    in two- and three-dimensional space, as well as image processing. Python comes with a large array
    of resources that support graphics operations. However, these operations are complex and not for the faint
    of heart.
