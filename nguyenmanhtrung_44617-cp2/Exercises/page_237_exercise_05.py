Problem:How would a column-major traversal of a grid work? Write a code segment that prints the positions
visited by a column-major traversal of a 2-by-3 grid.
Solution:
    A nested loop structure to traverse a grid consists of two loops, an outer one and an inner one.
Each loop has a different loop control variable. The outer loop iterates over one coordinate,
while the inner loop iterates over the other coordinate.
