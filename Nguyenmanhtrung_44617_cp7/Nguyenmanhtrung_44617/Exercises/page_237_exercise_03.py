Problem: Describe the difference between Cartesian coordinates and screen coordinates
Solution:
 A visual scene projects an infinite set of color and intensity values onto a two-dimensional sensing medium,
such as a human being’s retina or a scanner’s surface. If you sample enough of these values, the digital
information can represent an image that is more or less indistinguishable to the human eye from
the original scene.
